# Odin Library

## Overview  
**Odin Library** is a dynamic, browser-based library application built as part of the JavaScript curriculum in **The Odin Project**. The goal of this project was to practice working with **JavaScript objects**, **constructors/classes**, and **DOM manipulation** to create an interactive book management interface.

## Features  
- Add new books with title, author and read status  
- Display books dynamically on the page  
- Remove books from the library  
- Toggle read/unread status  
- Object-oriented design using constructors 
- Dynamic DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript
